Certainly, here are some motifs and patterns commonly found in viral genomes:

1. **ATG Start Codon:** The start codon "ATG" (AUG in RNA) is typically the initiation codon for protein-coding genes in many viruses.

2. **Stop Codons:** Common stop codons include "TAA," "TAG," and "TGA" in DNA viruses, or their RNA equivalents in RNA viruses.

3. **Promoter Elements:** Viral genes often have promoter elements like the TATA box (TATAAA) and enhancer sequences that initiate transcription.

4. **Polyadenylation Signal:** For RNA viruses, the polyadenylation signal (e.g., AAUAAA) marks the site for polyadenylation and mRNA processing.

5. **Splice Sites:** In RNA viruses or DNA viruses with introns, conserved splice donor (GU) and splice acceptor (AG) sites are essential.

6. **Consensus Sequences:** Many viral families have conserved motifs specific to their group. For example, the "GGGAGG" motif is commonly found in retroviruses.

7. **Hairpin Loops:** RNA viruses often have hairpin loop structures in their genomes. Detecting these structural motifs can be important.

8. **Shine-Dalgarno Sequence:** In some RNA viruses, a Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG) is found before the start codon and is involved in translation initiation.

9. **IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site):** Some RNA viruses have an IRES sequence that allows ribosomes to initiate translation internally, bypassing the 5' cap.

10. **Frameshift Signals:** Certain viruses use frameshift signals to change the reading frame during translation. Examples include "UUUAAAC" in HIV.

11. **Codon Usage Patterns:** Analyze codon usage bias, as some viruses have specific codon preferences.

12. **MicroRNA Target Sites:** Viral genomes may contain target sites for host microRNAs, which can influence viral gene regulation.

13. **Conserved Stem-Loop Structures:** Look for conserved stem-loop structures, which are common in viral genomes and can have regulatory roles.

14. **Palindromic Sequences:** Palindromic sequences can be involved in genome replication and recombination.

15. **CpG Islands:** Some DNA viruses have CpG islands in their promoters, which can influence gene expression.

16. **GC-Rich Regions:** GC-rich regions may indicate gene-rich regions or regulatory elements in the viral genome.

17. **Repetitive Elements:** Some viruses have repetitive elements, such as direct and inverted repeats, which play roles in replication and recombination.

18. **Kozak Sequence:** In eukaryotic viruses, the Kozak sequence (GCCRCCAUGG) around the start codon is important for translation initiation.

19. **Conserved Stem-Loop Structures:** Many RNA viruses have conserved stem-loop structures involved in replication and translation.

20. **Non-coding RNA Motifs:** Viral genomes may encode non-coding RNAs with their own conserved motifs, such as the TAR element in HIV.

Please note that the presence and significance of these motifs can vary greatly among different types of viruses. 
It's essential to consider the specific characteristics of the viral genome you are working with and conduct thorough analysis to identify relevant motifs for your gene prediction tool. 
Additionally, some motifs may be more relevant for protein-coding genes, while others are important for non-coding regions or regulatory elements in viral genomes.
